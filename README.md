Course 210:
JS Small Problems

These exercises focus on solving small code challenges in JavaScript, following the problem solving process we covered in course 210. The exercises here range from simple one-liners to small methods, but typically fall within the range of 10 - 30 lines of code. Most of these exercises can be completed in many ways, so take time to think about the tradeoffs of various approaches.
